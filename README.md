# Netflix-clone
I built an Netflix Clone 📸 using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 🎨✨. It features a responsive design 📱 with a navbar, profile section, feed layout, and post styling 🖼️. Bootstrap made it mobile-friendly and visually appealing 🚀. This project helped me sharpen my front-end development skills and improve UI/UX design! 💻🔥
